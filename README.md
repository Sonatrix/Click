# Click
We need to have earlang and elixir 1.12 installed on system.

Please check the docs doc/index.html or https://hexdocs.pm/click/0.1.0
for module related info
We have created test case for testing each scenerio.

No API has been created. This is simple test for testing the requirement.

Use mix deps.get after cloning the repo


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hexdocs.pm/click/0.1.0
), the package can be installed
by adding `click` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:click, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/click](https://hexdocs.pm/click).
